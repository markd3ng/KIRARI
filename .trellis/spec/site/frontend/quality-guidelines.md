# Quality Guidelines

## Build Reality

`@kirari/site` commands first materialize the profile. Production build order:

1. `materialize-profile.mjs`
2. `materialize-ghc-adapter.mjs`
3. `astro build`
4. `postbuild.mjs`

Postbuild runs seven ordered actions: generate headers/redirects, generate
robots metadata, obfuscate mailto links, conditionally build Pagefind, generate
LLM files, optionally submit IndexNow, and optionally submit Google Indexing
API notifications. Read the script before changing the list; old docs contain
shortened summaries.

## Markdown And Styles

Plugin order in `astro.config.mjs` is behavior. The current chains include
PlantUML and table wrapping in addition to math, reading time, excerpt,
admonitions, directives, sectioning, Mermaid, slugs, lazy images, components,
and heading links.

Use Tailwind/CSS for component appearance. Use `markdown-extend.styl` for
Markdown-generated deep DOM. Do not assume scoped Astro CSS styles nodes
created by browser scripts.

## Verification

Run from the workspace root:

```bash
node apps/site/scripts/qa-regression-check.mjs
pnpm site:type-check
pnpm site:astro-check
pnpm build
pnpm release:check
node apps/site/scripts/generate-vercel-config.mjs --check
```

CI additionally runs edge checks, release version checks, audit, and
`git diff --check`. Use pnpm and Node `>=22.12.0`.
